                            <p> So I’m trying to make a pattern of a simple video game logo for my boyfriend’s birthday. It’s a black logo in the shape of a 6, but instead of the typical circle a 6 makes it’s the outline of a gun. It’s a very simple design. However, I’ve attempted a couple different pattern making websites and apps and they all make the pattern very complicated and say I need 12 colors for a plain black and white design. I guess what I’m wondering is if there is any website or app for iOS that I can simply. This might seem like a weird question, but I'm fairly new to sewing. I've made a few garments. There seems to be a huge undercurrent of support and drive by sewers to support Indie patterns, which I totally get. But I've found that some Indie patterns lead to nothing but frustration. How do you learn who you can trust when it comes to a well drafted, well made pattern? I feel like I've already been burned by a few "big names" in Indie patterns where no matter what I did, I just ended up being. I have been bitten by the more projects than one bug. Now I'm thinking about making another CrossStitch. I am a beginning stitcher, but I'm loving this craft so much. I want to do a CrossStitch of Voltron from the new adaption on netflix. I have an image I want to use so I'm using a couple of different online free cross stitch patterns to find the best pattern build. I think I'm going to go with pixel-stitch. My biggest question is how i find the middle with the PDF page patterns where Hello! amp#x200B; I made a post (https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossStitch/comments/aqym97/chat_made_a_web_application_to_convert_pictures/) on r/CrossStitch a short while ago about a simple web app I made for converting digital images to cross-stitch patterns, and it seemed to be well-received, so I thought I would share it with fellow embroiderers as well! If you have any suggestions you would like to see please feel free to write them and I'll try to implement them. It's called CrossPiX Hi, Is there anyone who makes graph patterns? Or has a direction to point me in please and thank. While I have been working with leather for the better part of a year now, I am still very new, and to that effect, haven't really ventured into making my own patterns (save one set of bracers I made). I was just wondering if anyone has any tips or suggestions for starting patterns and how to work out what needs to go where. I have been using other patterns bought through Etsy and such, but would love to start making my own for obvious reasons. Any help is much appreciated, cheers.

What is the best pattern maker for SNES sprites? I have an image that is 252x252 px, so myphotostich won't work for me. Any suggestions are welcome. Despite PDFs being ubiquitous on the internet, with free viewer software \_everywhere\_, it is frustratingly difficult to find good software for creating/editing PDFs. Adobe wants me to pay like twelve bucks a month for the right, which is insane. What do you fine folks use to create your patterns. Hi everyone. My question is for those folks who post their patterns for sale on Etsy (and perhaps those who purchase patterns from Etsy as well). Recently, I have been so inspired to create cross stitch patterns (like this one below), that I am designing more content than I have time to stitch personally. Since I opened my Etsy store about 3 weeks ago, it has not been doing so well \- perhaps that could be for a variety of reasons. Anyway, I wonder whether one of those reasons Here is the list of top pattern makers, aluminium foundry pattern manufacturers, suppliers, pattern work companies in Coimbatore.
